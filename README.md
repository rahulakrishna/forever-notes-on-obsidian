## Forever Notes
---
[Forever Notes](https://www.myforevernotes.com/) is a framework for Apple Notes. It introduces a concept that is very similar to [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) in Obsidian. However, one major difference is how Daily Notes are organised. Forever Notes take inspiration from the concept of [Multi Year Diaries](https://www.midori-japan.co.jp/english/products/multi-year-diary-gate/) where a page for a date has sections for multiple years.
